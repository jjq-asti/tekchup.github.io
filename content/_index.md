Welcome to Tekchup!

This is the place where I share my thoughts and also my knowledge in software development and working with microcontroller projects.
I formerly aspire to become an embedded systems engineer, however, I ended up becoming a fullstack web developer.

I specialized in builidng system prototypes that may include microntrollers (i.e. Arduino, Atmel, STM32) , web application, database and even IOT.
